# IP creator (makeip)

**IP creator** (`makeip`) is an utility used for generating homebrew **Sega
Dreamcast** bootstrap files, also known as `IP` which stands for **Initial
Program**. This file is often named `IP.BIN`. It's a critical component for
any Dreamcast discs.

`IP.BIN` file is used for making selfboot (**MIL-CD**) discs for **Sega
Dreamcast** softwares. When the file is inserted in the bootsector of a disc,
the bootstrap program (`IP.BIN`) will execute the main program stored on the
file system which is often named `1ST_READ.BIN`. Please note, the `IP.BIN`
file is not needed on the file system as it's inserted in the bootsector.

**IP creator** will generates a custom `IP.BIN` file designed for homebrew
programs. It uses minimal copyrighted code, i.e. the minimum code that
can't be removed/altered in any way.

All `IP.BIN` files contains custom data fields used to describe some properties
of the software present on the disc. **IP creator** will allow you to edit
these fields. It also supports the insertion of custom images in the boot
screen. These kind of images are called **MR images** or **MR logos** and are
often stored in files with the `.mr` extension. You'll be able to convert
a **PNG** image into the **MR** format on-the-fly with **IP creator**.

Below you'll find an example of the *ADK/Napalm* MR image shown in the boot
screen (this **MR** logo was extracted from the `dcload` bootstrap):

## Building

This program is a standard C program which may be compiled with **GNU Make**.
It requires `libpng-dev` installed.
[Learn more about libpng here](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).

1. Edit the `Makefile` and check if everything is OK for you (e.g. `libpng`
   directories);
2. Enter `make` (`gmake` on BSD systems).

## Usage

To use this tool, several modes are available:

1. Using a IP template file (`ip.txt`);
2. Using command-line arguments.

Available options are (displayed with the `-h` switch):
	
	-f                 Force overwrite output file if already exist
	-h                 Print usage information (you're looking at it)
	-l <infilename>    Load/insert an image into bootstrap (MR; PNG)
	-t <tmplfilename>  Use an external IP.TMPL file (override default)
	-u                 Print field usage information
	-s <outfilename>   Save image from <infilename> to MR format (see '-l')
	-v                 Enable verbose mode

To learn more about **MR images**, please read below. You may use either a
raw `MR` image or a `PNG` image that will be converted on-the-fly.

### Using a IP template file

This mode is the historical way to populate the fields of the `IP.BIN` file.

Create a text file called `ip.txt` and write this content on it:

	Device Info   : CD-ROM1/1
	Area Symbols  : JUE
	Peripherals   : E000F10
	Product No    : T0000
	Version       : V1.000
	Release Date  : 20000627
	Boot Filename : 1ST_READ.BIN
	SW Maker Name : YOUR NAME HERE
	Game Title    : TITLE OF THE SOFTWARE

Then run the following command:

	makeip ip.txt IP.BIN

This will generate the `IP.BIN` with the above values.

You don't have to fill all the fields, removing them from the `ip.txt` will use
the default. So a minimal `ip.txt` file may be like:

	Product No    : T0000
	Version       : V1.000
	SW Maker Name : YOUR NAME HERE
	Game Title    : TITLE OF THE SOFTWARE

**Note:** In the original `ip.txt` files, you may have the fields **Hardware
ID** and **Maker ID** declared. They can't be altered so it isn't necessary
anymore to pass them. Plus, the **Device Info** field may contains a fake
**CRC** like `0000` (see below in the **Device Info** field sub-section for
more info), this isn't necessary now but it will still work if present. 

###  Using command-line arguments

If you want you may pass directly the field information by using the proper
switch. To print this list, use the `-u` switch instead of `-h`.

	-a <areasymbols>    Area sym (J)apan, (U)SA, (E)urope (default: JUE)
	-b <bootfilename>   Boot filename (default: 1ST_READ.BIN)
	-c <companyname>    Company name / SW maker name (default: KallistiOS)
	-d <releasedate>    Release date (format: YYYYMMDD, default: <today>)
	-e <version>        Product version (default: V1.000)
	-g <gametitle>      Title of the software (default: GAMETITLE)
	-i <deviceinfo>     Device info (format: CD-ROMx/y, default: CD-ROM1/1)
	-n <productno>      Product number (default: T-00000)
	-p <peripherals>    Peripherals (default: E000F10)

## MR Images

**MR Image** is a special image format that can be inserted in the boostrap.
This kind of image are often saved as `iplogo.mr` or equivalent.

With **IP creator** you will be able to:

* Insert a custom image in the generated bootstrap. It can be either raw
  **MR** format or **PNG** format;
* Convert an input file (i.e. a **PNG** file) into the **MR** format and
  save the result on the disk for later use.

### Inserting an image into bootstrap

Just pass the `-l` switch to the command-line:

	makeip -l iplogo.mr -v IP.BIN

You may pass a **PNG** file too:

	makeip -l iplogo.png -v IP.BIN

In that case, the **PNG** file will be converted on-the-fly in the **MR**
format before inserting in the bootstrap.

### About MR Image constraints

To be used in the generated `IP.BIN` file, the **MR image** must be:

1. **320 * 90** or less;
2. Less than **128** colors;
3. Less than **8192 Bytes**.

The transparent color is `#c0c0c0`, or `192`, `192`, `192` in RGB.

### Converting a PNG Image into a MR Image

If you just want to convert a **PNG** Image to a **MR** Image but not
generating the bootstrap, you may use **IP creator** like:

	makeip -l iplogo.png -s iplogo.mr -v

This will try to convert the `iplogo.png` to the `iplogo.mr` file.

Of course, you may generate a bootstrap and write the converted image
on the disk at the same time:

	makeip -l iplogo.png -s iplogo.mr -v IP.BIN

## Information about some specific fields

Some fields used in the bootstrap need to be detailed, as they are have
constraints:

* Area Symbols
* Device Information
* Peripherals
* Release Date
* (Product) Version

### Area Symbols

The **Area Symbols** field consists of 8 characters, which are either space or
a specific letter. Each of these represent a geographical region in which the
disc is designed to work. So far, only the first 3 are assigned, the 5 others
were never been used so they are just left blank.

Supported area are **Japan** (and the rest of East Asia), **USA + Canada**, and
**Europe**.

If the character for a particular region is a space, the disc will not be
playable in that region. If it contains the correct region character, it will
be.

The region characters used are `J`, `U`, and `E`, respectively. So a disc only
playable in Europe would have an Area Symbols string of `"  E     "`. This
operation is made by **IP creator**.

To summarize, if you want your program region-free, you just have to assign
`JUE` to the **Area Symbols** field. This is the case by default.

### Device Information

The **Device Information** field begins with a 4 digit hexadecimal number,
which is a **CRC** on the **Product Number** and **Product Version** fields
(16 bytes). Then comes the string `" CD-ROM"`, and finally an indication of how
many discs this software uses, and which of these discs that this is. This is
indicated by 2 positive numbers separated with a slash. So if this is the second
disc of three, the **Device Information** field might be something like 
`"8B40 CD-ROM2/3  "`.

Please note, commercial `IP.BIN` files (which aren't produced by **IP creator**)
supports the `" GD-ROM"` type. Also, the **CRC** value doesn't need to be
provided as it's computed automatically by the **IP creator** program.

In clear, you just have to pass `CD-ROMx/y` to that field, where `x` is the disc
number and `y` the total discs in the set. The default value is `CD-ROM1/1`.

### Peripherals

The **Peripherals** field is a 28 bit long bitfield represented by a 7 digit
hexadecimal number. The meaning of the individual bits in each digit is given
below:

	<A><-------B------> <C->
	0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
	^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^    ^    ^
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||||    |    |
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||||    |    +----- Uses Windows CE
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||||    |
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||||    +-----  VGA box support
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||||
	|||| |||| |||| |||| |||+----- Other expansions
	|||| |||| |||| |||| ||+----- Puru Puru pack
	|||| |||| |||| |||| |+----- Mike device
	|||| |||| |||| |||| +----- Memory card
	|||| |||| |||| |||+------ Start + A + B + Directions
	|||| |||| |||| ||+------ C button
	|||| |||| |||| |+------ D button
	|||| |||| |||| +------ X button
	|||| |||| |||+------- Y button
	|||| |||| ||+------- Z button
	|||| |||| |+------- Expanded direction buttons
	|||| |||| +------- Analog R trigger
	|||| |||+-------- Analog L trigger
	|||| ||+-------- Analog horizontal controller
	|||| |+-------- Analog vertical controller
	|||| +-------- Expanded analog horizontal
	|||+--------- Expanded analog vertical
	||+--------- Gun
	|+--------- Keyboard
	+--------- Mouse

The group of bits indicated by `B` above indicate the discs minimum controller
requirements. So if the **Z button** bit is set, the software can not be used
with a controller that doesn't have a **Z button**. The `A` group indicates
which optional peripherals the disc supports. The `C` group indicates which
kinds of expansion units that the disc supports. The `VGA box support` bit
indicates that the disc can be run in **VGA** mode. The `WinCE` bit speaks for
itself and shouldn't be used for any homebrew program, so you have to leave this
field to `0`.

### Release Date

The **Release Date** field is in the `YYYYMMDD` format. By default, it's
initialized with today.

### (Product) Version

The **Version** field is the `Vx.yyy` format, where `x` is the major number and
`yyy` the minor number. Default is `V1.000`.

## GIMP MR Image Plug-In

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a cross-platform image editor available for
GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows. The provided `gimp/file-mr.py` file is a 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) plug-in used for encode/decode **MR images**.
  
So by using this plug-in, you can load and save `.mr` files directly in GIMP.
As this plugin uses **Python-Fu**, you should have **Python extensions** enabled
in GIMP. [Read more here](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-filters-python-fu.html).

To install the GIMP Plug-In:

1. Make the plug-in executable: ```chmod +x file-mr.py``` or equivalent.
2. Place the plug-in in the `plugins` directory. This directory is different
   depending on what operating system you use. To find out go to `GIMP` >
   `Preferences` > `Folders` (*Expand option*) > `Plugins` (see below an
   example under **Windows**, but this applies to others OS).
3. That's it!
